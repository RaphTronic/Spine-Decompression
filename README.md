# Spine-Decompression

3D CAD file (same model in several formats) for the Spine Decompression stand described in my blog: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2023/08/diy-simple-spine-decompression-station.html

The Sketchup model (SKP & DAE files) is the master the others are converted from (those were not checked, might have issues?).

This is a simple build based on 2x4s and 3/4" wood boards.

Refer to the blog above for context and instructions.

Happy build to all !
